  "aboutUsContent": "<h2 class=\"ql-align-center\">HOSTEL PALMBURG – A QUIET HAVEN AWAY FROM THE HUSTLE AND BUSTLE OF THE CITY</h2><p>Welcome to the most modern and maritime hostel in Kaliningrad on the banks of the Pregolya River.</p><p>We are the Hostel Palmburg team!</p><p>Here you will take a break from the \"concrete jungle\".

Location</h3><p>The name \"Palmburg\" (from German - \"Palm City\") comes from the name of an estate with agricultural production, located next to the bridge. The owner of the estate grew exotic plants in greenhouses, among which were palms. We are located on the banks of the Pregolya River, in a quiet and picturesque place in our city. On the territory there is a fish restaurant \"Skipper\" and a yacht club \"Marina Palmburg\". There is a bus stop 50 m from us.</p><h3>2. Comfort</h3><p>The interior is made in a nautical style: doors with a porthole, vest curtains, seagull-shaped lamps, walls are painted with drawings on the appropriate theme, etc. In the recreation area, you can sit comfortably in a beanbag chair while watching a movie (at such venues as IVI, OKKO, Kinopoisk) or playing a game console. All rooms have individual lockers with locks for clothes and a separate locker for suitcases. The beds are equipped with sockets, a night light, a shelf and a clothes hanger. The kitchen is fully equipped for preparing delicious meals. There is also a washer and dryer so you can travel light. On the street you can use the gazebo with barbecue.
